We could have slots, for things like type.

When the slot is empty, autocomplete suggest:
* the autocomplete for simple values compatible with the lost, like typeRef (-> string, integer, number)
* the sequence of complex slots (-> sequence)

Could use virtual dom: https://github.com/Matt-Esch/virtual-dom
